This is a Python script to send out arp requests to a network and then scan for devices on that network. It uses the libraries Scapy, re, uuid and Socket.

This script is not intended for malicious use. It is intended for my personal educational only.

The script works by sending out arp requests to the network and then listening for the responses.

At the end of the script it will print out the ips and MAC addresses that responded along with the Ip and MAC of the computer that ran the script
